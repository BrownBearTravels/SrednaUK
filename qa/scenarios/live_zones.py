"""Put the device and the harness on the same, freshly served zone catalog.

Not a test of the app — the step that makes the rest of a live-zones run mean
something. Three things have to hold for a drive scenario's expectations to
describe the device it runs on:

1. **The device holds what `/api/zones` serves.** Poison the cached hash and
   backdate the cached version so both of `ZoneDataRecency`'s gates fall
   through, force a sync, require `Updated` (same trick as
   `sync.zones_all_usable`).
2. **The harness holds the same payload.** Download it right after, and check
   the served hash did not move across the device's fetch — the weekly cron
   publishes on Monday mornings, inside the nightly's window. Retried, because
   that race is real rather than theoretical.
3. **Neither moves for the rest of the run.** A run takes hours; the device
   would otherwise pick up a mid-run publish (periodic `ZoneSyncWorker` / BG
   task) or re-seed from a bundle that is newer than the feed (the normal state
   right after `refresh-zones.sh`). So the periodic sync is switched off and the
   cached version is pinned to the far future — `decide()` then skips any
   server payload and `shouldReseedFromBundle()` any bundle.

`release()` undoes (3) at the end of the run. A run killed before it gets there
heals on the next one: this step re-pins the version, and `sync.zones_toggle_off`
turns the periodic sync back on.

Scenarios are *built* from the catalog, so everything after this step in a suite
has to be built after it has run — see `_live_plan` / `_nightly` in
`srednabg_qa.py`.
