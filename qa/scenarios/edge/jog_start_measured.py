"""Jog-start zone, honest approach: the traversal must still be MEASURED.

The positive-path companion to `edge.mid_zone_join`. That scenario proves an
unwitnessed entry opens `ZoneState.Unmeasured`; this one proves the rule didn't
overshoot and start refusing to measure real entries on the awkward half of the
zone data.

An ISSUE-001 zone is one whose stored centerline opens with a segment pointing
**away** from the road's direction (`cl[0]` is the camera, `cl[1]` sits *behind*
it, and the line only turns forward after that). A driver crossing that camera
therefore projects onto the far end of the jog rather than onto arc 0. The
original case was `i3-02-north`, whose jog was 121 m — past the 100 m an earlier
draft of the rule would have allowed, and the reason `START_WITNESS_ARC_M` is
200 m rather than 100 m. The core unit test (`ZoneUnmeasuredTest."a zone whose
centerline starts with a backwards jog is still measurable"` / Swift twin) pins
that band at unit level on a synthetic fixture; this drives real geometry
end-to-end.

**The zone is chosen from the catalog under test, not named**: the one with the
longest opening jog (`longest_jog_zone`). The jog is a data defect, and the
scraper keeps fixing them — the served feed lost `i3-02-north`'s on 2026-09-28,
leaving 80 m on `i6-01-east` as the longest. A scenario pinned to one zone dies
the night its defect is repaired upstream; this one moves to the worst jog that
is still really being served, and fails loudly (`MIN_JOG_M`) only once none is
left, which is the day to retire it.

Asserts:
  (a) `InZone` is reached for the zone — a genuine approach still measures,
  (b) `Unmeasured` is never reported for it — the witness rule didn't misfire.

Both halves matter: (a) alone would pass on an engine that measures everything,
(b) alone would pass on a drive that never matched the zone at all.

**Verified to discriminate — on the 121 m jog.** Replaying the `i3-02-north`
trace through the Kotlin engine against the full real zone catalogue: with
`START_WITNESS_ARC_M = 200` it reports `InZone(i3-02-north)` at fix 88; with the
threshold tightened to 100 m the same drive reports `Unmeasured(i3-02-north)` —
the failure (a) forbids. That holds for a jog longer than 100 m. On a shorter
one (all the live feed has left) this still proves a jog-start zone is measured
end-to-end, but no longer separates 200 m from 100 m — the unit test does.

The drive is built here rather than via `base_plan`, which resamples the stored
centerline verbatim: on this zone that would make the car reverse 121 m at the
camera and pivot 180°, a manoeuvre no real drive performs and one whose
direction-match behaviour would be testing the fixture, not the engine. See
`physical_road_plan`.
